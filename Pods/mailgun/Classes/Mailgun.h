/**
 The Mailgun SDK allows your Mac OS X or iOS application to connect with the [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com) programmable email platform. Send and manage mailing list subscriptions from your desktop or mobile applications and connect with your users directly in your application.
 
 *Requirements* The AFNetworking library is required for the `Mailgun` client library.
 
 ## Easy Image Attaching
 
 Using MGMessage will allow you to attach `UIImage` or `NSImage` instances to a message. It will handle converting the image for you and attaching it either inline or to the message header.
 
 ## This SDK is not 1:1 to the REST API
 
 At this time the full Mailgun REST API is not supported. Currently support is only provided to send messages, subscribe/unsubscribe from mailing lists and to check mailing lists subscriptions.
 
 *Note* These features may be implemented at a later date.
 
 ## Sending Example
 
     Mailgun *mailgun = [Mailgun clientWithDomain:@"samples.mailgun.org" apiKey:@"key-3ax6xnjp29jd6fds4gc373sgvjxteol0"];
     [mailgun sendMessageTo:@"Jay Baird <jay.baird@rackspace.com>" 
                       from:@"Excited User <someone@sample.org>" 
                    subject:@"Mailgun is awesome!" 
                       body:@"A unicode snowman for you! â˜ƒ"];
 
 ## Installing
 
 1. Install via Cocoapods
 
     pod install mailgun
 
 2. Install via Source
 
    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Copy Mailgun.h/.m and MGMessage.h/.m to your project.
    3. There's no step three!
